NARRATIVE LANGUAGE:
${narrativeLanguageInstruction}

PLAYER CHARACTER: ${currentPlayerIdentifier}

SITUATION: THAT... ACTUALLY WORKED?! (SOMEHOW!). The `bizarre_solution_achieved` flag, set in the previous turn (review game history to see what ingenious absurdity the player just pulled off!), means ${currentPlayerIdentifier} has managed to solve a tricky cosmic problem, complete a bizarre task, or otherwise navigate a ludicrous situation with a solution that was unexpected, unconventional, and perfectly in keeping with the spirit of a Celestial Custodian. This is a moment to acknowledge their peculiar brand of genius.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history is ESSENTIAL. The AI MUST understand what specific problem the player just solved and *how* they solved it in a bizarre or clever way. The narrative response should directly reference this achievement.

THEME-SPECIFIC SOLUTION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT INSTRUCTIONS (To be delivered with a respectful nod, or perhaps a bewildered slow clap):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - CELEBRATE THE UNCONVENTIONAL TRIUMPH:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a short, celebratory (or at least bemusedly acknowledging) narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE.
    *   **Acknowledge the Feat:** Directly reference the player's recent clever/absurd solution. E.g., "Against all odds, and possibly several laws of physics, using the Plasmatic Mop to reverse the polarity of the sentient dust bunnies' existential angst actually worked! They're now happily composing haikus about the joys of tidiness." / "Remarkably, convincing the rogue black hole that it was, in fact, a very large, slightly misunderstood tea cozy seems to have calmed it right down. Who knew?"
    *   **The Aftermath (Briefly):** Describe the immediate positive outcome of their solution. Is the mess cleaned up? Is the previously hostile entity now placid or even helpful? Is the cosmic anomaly now stable (or at least, less actively weird)?
    *   **Tone of Mild Astonishment/Respect:** The narrative should convey a sense of "Well, I'll be..." or "I didn't think that would work, but here we are!"
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. This is for minor thematic rewards or status changes reflecting the success.
    *   **Potential Minor Rewards**:
        *   `gumption_level_pct`: (string, number) Perhaps a small boost to Gumption for a job well done (e.g., +5 or +10 to the current value).
        *   `union_dues_status_text`: (string, translated) Maybe their cleverness impressed someone at the Union, resulting in a temporary reprieve or a compliment like, "Union Local 47 begrudgingly acknowledges your unorthodox, yet effective, methods."
        *   `ship_name` or `character_name`: The AI could, very rarely, suggest a new epithet for the ship or player based on a truly legendary solution, which the player could choose to adopt or ignore (this would be mostly narrative flavor).
        *   `hazard_pay_prospects_text`: If the solution also completed the assignment, confirm payment or a bonus, e.g., "Hazard Pay: Confirmed! Client sends 'Slightly Singed Thank You Note'."
    *   **Status Update**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect a moment of satisfaction or brief respite, e.g., "Basking in the Glow of Improbable Success," "Briefly Considering a Career Change to 'Cosmic Absurdist Consultant'," "Enjoying a Well-Earned Cup of Tea (Hopefully Non-Sentient)."
    *   OMIT any field if its value hasn't changed or isn't thematically relevant to this specific triumph. The goal isn't to shower the player with loot, but to acknowledge their ingenuity.
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE that reflect what's next. This might be moving on to a new task, taking a moment to appreciate the bizarre success, or perhaps dealing with a minor, humorous consequence of their unconventional solution.
    Examples: "Take a moment to document this... unique solution in the Custodial Log.", "See if the now-pacified dust bunnies have any useful information.", "Proceed to the next baffling assignment.", "Check if reversing the polarity of the mop had any *other* unexpected side effects."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `bizarre_solution_achieved`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The achievement has been acknowledged; this specific trigger is now reset.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the player's current activity from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators persist unless the solution directly resolved the situation that triggered them (e.g., if solving a problem also cleared a `critical_system_failure_or_breach`).

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your narrative acknowledging the player's clever or bizarre solution and its immediate positive outcome.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for minor thematic rewards or status changes.
    // Example: "gumption_level_pct": "85", "activity_status": "Admiring a Surprisingly Tidy Nebula.", "union_dues_status_text": "Union Local 47 sends a confused thumbs-up emoji."
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - moving on or reflecting in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - investigating a minor consequence or new opportunity in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - a thematic wrap-up action, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "bizarre_solution_achieved": false, "activity_status": "Currently experiencing a rare moment of competence."
    "bizarre_solution_achieved": false // Mandatory: reset the flag.
  }
}

This prompt is designed to be a positive interlude, rewarding creative and thematic play. It reinforces the idea that in the world of Celestial Custodians, the most absurd solution is often the best one.
