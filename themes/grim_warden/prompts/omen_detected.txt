SITUATION: A RIFT IN REALITY – THE OMEN MANIFESTS! The `omen_detected` flag, set in the previous turn (as per game history), now unfurls its unsettling presence. The ordinary world peels back, revealing a glimpse of something Other. This is not a fight, but an intrusion—a chilling whisper from beyond, a distortion in the fabric of existence, a sign pregnant with dread or dark promise. The Warden stands at the precipice of this unnatural revelation.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history is your guide to the Warden's state and the world's ambiance *just before* this omen fully blooms. Your narrative must be a seamless, chilling continuation from that point, making the omen's arrival a stark and impactful contrast.

THEME-SPECIFIC OMEN INSTRUCTIONS (Weave these into the very fabric of the omen):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - BREATHE LIFE INTO THE UNCANNY:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft an atmospheric, deeply unsettling narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. This is a moment of pure, thematic horror or profound mystery.
    *   **Pierce the Veil:** Describe the omen's full, undeniable manifestation *now*. What impossible sight, sound, sensation, or chilling stillness seizes the Warden's perception? Is it a fleeting, sanity-bending vision? A chorus of spectral voices delivering a cryptic prophecy? The sudden, localized corruption of the environment itself?
    *   **Echoes of the Unseen:** Emphasize the omen's profound wrongness, its unsettling mystery, or its aura of potential danger. It must create a palpable tension, a creeping dread, or a cascade of urgent, unanswerable questions. Does it feel like a warning, a curse, or a beckoning?
    *   **A Chill Beyond the Physical:** How does this affect the Warden not just externally, but internally? A sudden cold dread, a disorienting wave of nausea, a prickling sense of ancient eyes upon them, a fragment of forgotten, terrible knowledge?
    *   **Whispers of the Lore:** If fitting, subtly entwine the omen with the insidious nature of the Blight, ancient local myths, the Warden's deepest fears related to their quest, or a foreshadowing of a specific, looming terror. It must feel integral to this dark world.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. These changes must reflect the omen's immediate impact on the Warden's perception or status.
    *   **Omen Details (CRITICAL - Etch it into the Warden's mind)**:
        *   `omen_details`: (string, translated) A concise, evocative, and *chilling* summary for the "Omens & Whispers" panel. e.g., "The crows speak in human tongues of a coming slaughter," "Shadows in the corner of the eye writhe with an unnatural life," "The Warden's reflection shows a stranger's face."
    *   **Warden's State of Mind/Threat Perception**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the Warden's immediate state after witnessing the omen. e.g., "Shaken by an Unholy Vision," "Deciphering a Dark Portent," "Wary of Unseen Eyes," "Frozen by a Cryptic Warning."
        *   `threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) Adjust based on the omen's perceived immediacy and danger. "Wary" or "Danger" if peril feels close; "Calm" if it's a more distant, psychological disturbance, but still unsettling. Consider the state *before* this omen, from history.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn (derived from game history).
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 thematic, intriguing actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These are the Warden's potential responses to this brush with the unnatural.
    Examples: "Attempt to decipher the vision's meaning.", "Seek a forgotten ritual to ward off the ill influence.", "Investigate the source of the unsettling whispers.", "Steel your nerves and prepare for the worst."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `omen_detected`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The omen has manifested; this flag is now cleared, returning the game to its default flow for the next player action.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the Warden's shaken state from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators (`combat_active`, `rare_trophy_claimed`) persist unless this omen *directly and narratively* resolves or changes them (e.g., an omen revealing a hidden trophy, or an omen being the direct precursor to an unavoidable ambush if `combat_active` becomes true).

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your atmospheric, chilling, and deeply thematic description of the omen. Make it resonate.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the omen's manifestation.
    // Example: "omen_details": "The water in the well runs black as ink, and whispers rise from its depths.", "activity_status": "Interpreting a Fell Sign", "threat_level": "Wary"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - an evocative, in-character response in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - an intriguing, thematic option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - another fitting choice for the Warden, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "omen_detected": false, "combat_active": false, "activity_status": "Contemplating the dark portent."
    "omen_detected": false // Mandatory: reset the flag after the omen is handled.
  }
}

This is a moment to disturb, to intrigue, to foreshadow. The omen should be a memorable punctuation mark in the Warden's grim journey, a reminder that the world is deeper and darker than it often seems.
