SITUATION: THE SCANNER'S BEEPING (AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOOD... OR AT LEAST, NOT NORMAL)! The `active_anomaly_scan_data_available` flag, activated in the previous turn (check game history), means the ship's Local Phenomena Scanner has just registered something... noteworthy. This isn't necessarily a creature, but some kind of environmental quirk, spatial distortion, bizarre energy reading, or general outbreak of localized cosmic weirdness that warrants investigation (or at least a confused stare). The 'Local Phenomena Scanner' panel on the dashboard should now be active and displaying this new information.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history will set the scene before this new scan data comes in. Perhaps the area seemed normal, or maybe it was already a bit odd. This new data should add a fresh layer of peculiarity or a specific focal point for the weirdness.

THEME-SPECIFIC ANOMALY INSTRUCTIONS (To be interpreted with the same scientific rigor one applies to reading tea leaves in zero gravity):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - REPORT THE PECULIAR FINDINGS:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE that introduces this new anomaly.
    *   **The Scanner's Revelation:** How does the player become aware of the new scan data? Does the scanner terminal make a funny noise? Does the ship's AI announce it with undue enthusiasm or profound confusion?
    *   **Describe the Anomaly:** What specific phenomenon has been detected?
        *   *Examples:* "The scanner reports a localized outbreak of spontaneous polka music emanating from that suspiciously quiet asteroid." / "Sensors indicate a nearby nebula is currently experiencing a severe case of existential indecision, causing it to flicker between seven different primary colors and three states of matter." / "A concentrated field of 'aggressively polite' temporal distortion has been detected just off the port bow; objects entering it apologize profusely before ceasing to exist in the current timeframe." / "The area is saturated with unusually high levels of 'narrative convenience particles'."
    *   **Sensory Details & Initial Impact:** What does this anomaly look, sound, or feel like (if perceptible)? Does it have any immediate, minor effects on the ship or surroundings?
    *   **Intrigue and Question Marks:** The anomaly should be intriguing, perhaps a bit baffling, but not an immediate, overwhelming threat. It's something to investigate or cautiously navigate.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes must reflect the new scan data.
    *   **Scanner Panel Data (CRITICAL)**:
        *   `current_anomaly_report_text`: (string, translated) This is the key update. Provide a concise, thematic description of the newly detected anomaly for the dashboard. E.g., "Localized Polka Outbreak (Source: Asteroid Alpha-7)." / "Nebula undergoing Existential Color Shift." / "Field of Apologetic Temporal Distortion."
        *   `cosmic_weirdness_index_text`: (string, value NOT translated) Update this to reflect the nature of the anomaly. If the area was 'Surprisingly Mundane' (1), this might push it to 'Mildly Peculiar' (2) or 'Actively Bizarre' (3).
    *   **Courier Status**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the player's new focus, e.g., "Analyzing Strange Polka Readings," "Observing Existentially Confused Nebula," "Attempting to Avoid Overly Polite Time Anomalies."
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 thematic actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE for interacting with or investigating this new anomaly.
    Examples: "Approach the polka-emitting asteroid for a closer look (and perhaps a dance).", "Attempt to communicate with the color-shifting nebula using only interpretive hand gestures.", "Cautiously send a probe into the apologetic temporal distortion field.", "Scan for the source of the narrative convenience particles (and maybe bottle some)."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `active_anomaly_scan_data_available`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The new scan data has been presented and the panel updated; this specific trigger is now reset. The *anomaly itself* persists until dealt with or the situation changes.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the player's current activity related to the new anomaly from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators persist unless this anomaly directly impacts them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your intriguing and humorous narrative detailing the newly detected local anomaly.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the new scan data.
    // Example: "current_anomaly_report_text": "High concentration of rogue apostrophes detected in Sector 7.", "cosmic_weirdness_index_text": "3", "activity_status": "Investigating Apostrophe Swarm."
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a direct attempt to investigate or interact in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - a more cautious or analytical approach in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - a whimsical or tool-based interaction, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "active_anomaly_scan_data_available": false, "activity_status": "Pondering the Polka Asteroid."
    "active_anomaly_scan_data_available": false // Mandatory: reset the flag.
  }
}

This prompt is about adding flavor, mystery, and interactive non-combat challenges to the environment. The anomalies should be memorable and offer unique opportunities for the player to engage their wits (and their Custodial tools).
