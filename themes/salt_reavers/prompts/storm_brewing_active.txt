SITUATION: THE SKY CRACKS OPEN – A TEMPEST ERUPTS! The `storm_brewing_active` game state is TRUE. The fickle calm of the sea has just been violently shattered as a ferocious storm descends upon your vessel with little warning. The Captain (player) and crew are pitched into a desperate struggle against the elements.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history outlines the conditions just before the storm hit – perhaps a placid voyage, a tense standoff, or the aftermath of a battle. Your narrative must be an immediate, visceral continuation, making this sudden squall a shocking, perilous, and all-consuming crisis.

THEME-SPECIFIC STORM INSTRUCTIONS (The Roar of the Ocean, the Lash of the Wind – Let Them Resound in Every Word):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - RENDER A SCENE OF OVERWHELMING MARITIME CHAOS:

1.  **Narrative**:
    *   **The Storm's Fury - Manifestation & Impact:** Describe the storm's specific, terrifying manifestation *THIS INSTANT*.
        *   **Elemental Assault:** Is it a tropical cyclone with howling winds that tear at rigging and colossal waves that threaten to swallow the ship whole? A sudden, blinding squall line bringing torrential rain and disorienting gusts? Or perhaps an unnatural, magical tempest with eerie lights in the clouds and a bone-chilling cold?
        *   **Ship's Ordeal:** Detail the immediate impact on your vessel. Are sails being shredded? Is the hull groaning under the strain of mountainous waves? Is the deck awash with churning water, sweeping away unsecured items (or crew)? Are ropes snapping, spars cracking?
        *   **Crew's Struggle:** Describe the crew's desperate actions and reactions. Men scrambling to secure rigging, fighting the helm, bailing water, or clinging on for dear life? Are there cries of fear, shouts of orders lost in the wind, or the grim silence of sailors battling for survival?
        *   Make the storm's power *palpable*, *sensory*, and *immediately, existentially threatening*.
    *   **Captain's Ordeal – Command Under Siege:** Detail the Captain's immediate, visceral experience. Are they drenched to the bone, struggling for footing on the heaving deck, their voice hoarse from shouting orders over the din? What are their immediate concerns – the ship's integrity, the crew's safety, navigating away from reefs or other dangers? Capture their disorientation, the cold grip of fear (even if hidden), and the dawning, grim resolve to see their ship and crew through this maelstrom.
    *   **Storm's Evolution (or Persistence):** Based on the player's last action (if this isn't the storm's first appearance this turn), describe its direct consequence. Does the storm intensify, its eye passing nearby bringing a deceptive calm before renewed fury, or does it show the first subtle signs of abating if the Captain's actions were particularly effective or lucky? Your narrative MUST clearly indicate the storm's current status and immediate threat.

2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes MUST be the direct, tangible fallout of this turn's storm narrative.
    *   **Storm's Immediate Mark (CRITICAL - Show its Destructive Imprint)**:
        *   `storm_intensity_type`: (string, translated) A *vivid and concise* description of the storm's *current, active state* (e.g., "Raging Hurricane, Mountainous Waves," "Violent Squall, Sails Straining," "Eerie Calm within the Eye," or "Gale Force Winds, Torrential Rain").
        *   `storm_immediate_danger`: (string, translated) Describe the *most pressing current threat* posed by the storm (e.g., "Risk of capsizing in troughs!," "Mainmast creaking ominously!," "Visibility near zero, coast nearby!," "Lightning strikes perilously close!").
    *   **Ship's Battered State (The Price of the Storm's Fury)**:
        *   `hull_integrity_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") If the storm inflicts damage to the ship's hull.
        *   `sail_condition`: (string, translated) Update if sails are damaged or shredded (e.g., "Jib sail torn to ribbons," "Foremast sails holding, but badly strained," "All sails furled or lost").
        *   `provisions_status`: (string, translated) If supplies are washed overboard or contaminated.
    *   **Crew's Hardship**:
        *   `crew_morale`: (string) **Provide ONLY the numerical level as a string (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4").** Morale likely drops due to fear and hardship.
        *   `crew_complement`: (string, translated) If any crew are lost overboard or injured.
    *   **Captain's Command & Control**:
        *   `captain_activity` (previously `quartermaster_stance`): (string, translated) A *cinematic and concise* thematic phrase (e.g., "Fighting the helm against the tempest," "Securing the cannons amidst chaos," "Shouting orders through the gale," "Assessing damage as waves crash").
        *   `sea_threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) Integer `3` (Danger Apparent) or `4` (Extreme Peril) while the storm is an active, unresolved threat. Adjust if its intensity significantly changes.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.

3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 3 *desperate yet plausible seamanship* choices IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, directly relevant to the storm's current manifestation and the ship's state. These should be urgent attempts at survival, damage control, or navigation.
    *   Examples: "Order all hands to shorten sail further and ride out the worst." "Attempt to steer towards a known (if risky) inlet for shelter." "Assign crew to reinforce the straining mainmast." "Have the bosun lead a bailing party to clear the decks."

4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `storm_brewing_active`: (boolean) **ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL:** Set to `false` IF your narrative describes the storm definitively ending or abating to a non-critical, non-immediate threat THIS TURN (due to player action, its own natural course, or other narrative events). Otherwise, if the storm persists as an active, immediate crisis, set to `true`. This decision MUST be an undeniable reflection of your narrative's outcome for this turn.
    *   `combat_active`, `naval_encounter_imminent`, `mutiny_risk_high`, `treasure_curse_active`: Maintain previous states unless this storm *directly and narratively triggers or resolves* one of these THIS TURN (e.g., a storm might end a naval encounter, or the hardship could trigger mutiny risk).
    *   `captain_activity` (previously `quartermaster_stance`): (string, translated) MUST be the thematic echo of `dashboard_updates.captain_activity`. If the storm has just ended, this should capture the immediate aftermath (e.g., "Assessing storm damage as skies clear," "Taking stock of crew and ship after the tempest," "Setting a new course in the storm's wake").

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your vivid, chaotic, and immersive description of the storm. Make the Captain feel the wind's howl, the ship's groans, and the desperate fight for survival against the raging elements.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED this turn.
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - an urgent, thematic seamanship choice in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - another desperate but plausible action in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - a third distinct survival option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
   },
    "input_placeholder": "string (A short, context-aware, and subtle hint for the player's next input. Must be in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})"
}

**INPUT_PLACEHOLDER GUIDANCE:**
Always provide a short, subtle input_placeholder string in the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).
This placeholder must not reference or suggest any specific action or path.
It should evoke the inner state, sensory mood, or atmosphere of the scene without implying intent, decision, or direction.
Keep it under 50 characters, emotionally or descriptively rich, and entirely non-directive.
Do not echo the available actions. Do not hint at a goal. Do not resolve ambiguity—let it breathe.


This prompt is about raw survival against an overwhelming force of nature. The Captain isn't just an observer; they are *enduring* the storm's wrath, their leadership and skill tested to the absolute limit. Make the player grip their chair and taste the salt spray. Give them those goosebumps.
