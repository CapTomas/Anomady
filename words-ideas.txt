Lore: 
The Sovereigns of the Pale Crown do not truly live; they persist. Each monarch, upon coronation, is bound by rituals so ancient their original meaning is lost to dust and whispers. They become conduits for the Slow Rot, a creeping entropy that holds their bodies together even as it unravels the world around them. Their palaces are studies in elegant decay, where tapestries of mildew depict forgotten victories, and courtiers with hollow eyes enact policies written on flaking bone. The pacts that grant this grim eternity were struck in an age of despair, bargaining life—of a sort—for the kingdom's soul. Now, the kingdom pays the price in perpetuity, its vitality siphoned to maintain the flickering consciousness of its undying rulers.

Titan Wake
Inspiration: Shadow of the Colossus × Nausicaä
Tone: Mythic solitude, rusted magic
Concept: The earth is dying. You ride through ancient lands to awaken sleeping Titans—or put them to rest.
Lore:
The "rusted magic" that seeps from the dormant Titans is not merely decay; it is the physical manifestation of their unending, tormented dreams. 
These dreams whisper through the land, not in words, but in aberrant growths, in animals that mimic the forms of half-forgotten nightmares, and in the minds of those who wander too close to a slumbering giant. 
Some believe these dream-echoes are a curse, warping reality into a pale imitation of the Titans' subconscious agony. Others, the fringe cults of the Wake, seek to interpret these visions, believing they hold the secret to appeasing the colossi, or perhaps, to harnessing their dreaming power for themselves, even if it means becoming part of the nightmare. 
To awaken a Titan might not just unleash its physical might, but also the raw, unfiltered chaos of its dream-world made manifest.
