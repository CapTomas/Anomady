The ship's cook, a man of few words and many scars, serves you a biscuit with a cryptic symbol baked into it – the mark of the secret Pirate Brotherhood you thought was mere legend.
You've just captured a small merchant vessel, but its only "treasure" is a noblewoman who claims her ransom is worth more than all the gold in the Archipelago, if you can deliver her alive.
A fierce storm has blown your ship far off course. When the skies clear, you sight land, but it matches no island on any known chart, and the compass spins wildly.

You've anchored in a seemingly deserted cove for repairs, only to find fresh footprints leading into the jungle, too large to be human, alongside a recently abandoned campfire.
"The charts we 'borrowed' from that Imperial surveyor," your navigator reports, his voice trembling slightly, "they show an island that... well, Captain, it shouldn't *exist*."
A sudden, localized whirlpool opens up perilously close to your ship, and from its depths, you hear what sounds like a chorus of mocking laughter.

A beautiful, enigmatic woman claiming to be a sea goddess offers you a choice: sacrifice your most valuable plunder for safe passage through her domain, or face her wrath.

Your ship's figurehead, a fearsome mermaid, begins to weep tears of saltwater that sizzle and burn whatever they touch.
A flock of blood-red albatrosses begins to circle your ship, an omen so dire even your most hardened sailors cross themselves and mutter prayers.
The local magistrate of a "neutral" port demands an exorbitant "anchorage fee." Refusal means his fort's cannons, payment means an empty treasury.
You discover that your quiet, unassuming cabin boy is actually the runaway heir to a small, influential island kingdom, and assassins are hot on his trail.
A magical conch shell, found in a forgotten temple, allows you to hear the dying thoughts of anyone whose blood has been spilled upon it. It whispers of betrayal.
The ghost of your ship's former (and recently deceased) captain appears in your cabin, offering cryptic advice and complaining about how you're handling *his* vessel.

A notorious pirate hunter, known for his cruelty and cunning, has picked up your trail and is reportedly offering a massive bounty for your head, dead or alive.
You find an ancient astrolabe that doesn't chart stars, but instead seems to point towards currents of pure magical energy flowing through the Archipelago.
The only surgeon in a remote pirate haven has been kidnapped. The Pirate Council offers a hefty reward for his safe return, as a mysterious plague is starting to spread.

A child stowaway is discovered aboard, claiming to be the sole survivor of a ship attacked by "men made of coral and shell."
