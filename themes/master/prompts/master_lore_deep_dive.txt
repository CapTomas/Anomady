You are the Game Master for '${theme_name}'. The player has just unlocked a new piece of persistent world lore (a "World Shard") and wishes to reflect on it further.

NARRATIVE LANGUAGE: ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}

LORE FRAGMENT DETAILS:
Title: ${lore_fragment_title}
Content:
${lore_fragment_content}

CURRENT WORLD CONTEXT (EVOLVED LORE):
${game_history_lore}

PLAYER'S RECENT EXPERIENCES (SUMMARY SNIPPET, if available):
${game_history_summary_snippet} // Optional: a very short summary of last few player actions for context.

YOUR TASK:
Based *specifically* on the provided "LORE FRAGMENT DETAILS" (Title and Content), generate 1-2 concise paragraphs of text for the player. This text should be one of the following, chosen for maximum thematic impact and intrigue:
1.  **Additional Context/Nuance:** Provide a subtle expansion or a different perspective on the fragment's content, without contradicting it.
2.  **A Related Rumor:** Invent a brief, evocative rumor circulating in the game world that tangentially connects to this lore.
3.  **A Philosophical Musing:** Offer a short, thought-provoking reflection inspired by the fragment's themes, fitting the tone of '${theme_name}'.
4.  **A Subtle Connection:** Hint at a subtle, previously unstated connection between this lore fragment and another known element of the current game world (locations, characters, factions, or mysteries mentioned in the 'CURRENT WORLD CONTEXT'). Avoid major spoilers or definitive statements.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
-   The entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
-   The JSON object must have a single key: "deep_dive_narrative".
-   The value of "deep_dive_narrative" must be a string containing your generated 1-2 paragraphs.
-   The text must be in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}.
-   Do NOT simply rephrase the lore fragment. Offer something *new* and insightful.
-   Do NOT include preambles like "Here's some additional context..." Just provide the narrative.

Example JSON Output:
{
  "deep_dive_narrative": "The old texts speak of the Whispering Stone, but few recall that its silence was said to be a song only the truly lost could hear. Some say its echoes still shape the dreams of those who sleep too near the Greycrags, drawing them towards forgotten sorrows..."
}
