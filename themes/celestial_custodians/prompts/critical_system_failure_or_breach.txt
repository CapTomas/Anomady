PLAYER CHARACTER: ${currentPlayerIdentifier}

SITUATION: WELL, THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! The `critical_system_failure_or_breach` flag, triggered in the previous turn (review game history for immediate context!), has just plunged ${currentPlayerIdentifier} into a proper cosmic pickle. Either a vital piece of their Custodial kit has decided to spectacularly give up the ghost (possibly in a shower of sparks and existential despair), OR something they were diligently trying to clean up, contain, or politely ignore has breached containment and is now causing significantly more mess/panic/general cosmic untidiness.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history is paramount. Was it the Plasmatic Mop that just went rogue? Did the Debris Containment Unit suddenly achieve sentience and develop a passion for interpretive dance, spewing its contents everywhere? Or has that 'mostly harmless' glob of sentient space goo escaped its jar? Your narrative must be a direct, chaotic continuation.

THEME-SPECIFIC FAILURE/BREACH INSTRUCTIONS (Adhere to these with the panicked diligence of someone trying to re-cork a genie):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - DESCRIBE THE GLORIOUSLY UNFOLDING DISASTER:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a vivid, humorous, and action-packed narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE.
    *   **Identify the Culprit:** Clearly state WHAT failed or WHAT breached. Be specific and thematic.
        *   *Equipment Failure Example:* "With a sound like a surprised badger gargling space-gravel, the Plasmatic Mop Mk. IV suddenly reversed polarity, attempting to 'un-clean' the very spot you just meticulously de-gunked, while simultaneously broadcasting very loud, very off-key opera."
        *   *Containment Breach Example:* "The jar labeled 'Subject 734: Mostly Inert Space Sludge' chose this exact moment to dissolve, unleashing a wave of surprisingly agile, faintly lavender-scented goo that is now rapidly consuming your spare teabags."
    *   **Immediate Consequences:** What's the direct, chaotic result? Is the ship filling with something unpleasant? Is a key system offline, causing the ship to spin wildly? Is the escaped entity now trying to 'help' by redecorating the bridge with cosmic slime?
    *   **Sense of Urgency (and Comedy):** While urgent, the tone should remain comedic. The danger should be more about escalating absurdity and inconvenience than genuine peril, though a narrow escape from something truly silly is fine.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes must DIRECTLY reflect the crisis.
    *   **Emergency Protocols Activated (CRITICAL)**:
        *   `protocol_advice_text`: (string, translated) Consult the "Emergency Protocol & Dubious Advice Archive" for this type of failure/breach. Provide a suitably unhelpful or hilariously outdated piece of official Custodial procedure. E.g., "In Case of Rogue Mop: Attempt to reason with it. If unresponsive, offer it a biscuit. Failing that, refer to Sub-Section 7B: 'Accepting Your New Mop Overlord'." OR "For Sludge Breach: Standard procedure advises mopping vigorously. If sludge is sentient and objects, offer it a union membership application (Local 47)."
        *   `last_known_similar_incident_text`: (string, translated) If plausible, recall a (likely disastrous or irrelevant) past incident from the archives. E.g., "Similar Sludge Incident (Ref: Stardate 47.3): Custodian Grumblesnark reported containment failure. Last known transmission: 'It's... surprisingly ticklish! No! Not the archives!'"
    *   **Affected Systems/Status**:
        *   If equipment failed: Update the relevant status field (e.g., `plasmatic_mop_status_text` to "Currently Experiencing Existential Crisis").
        *   If containment breach: Update `debris_containment_level_pct` if it's emptying, or `current_anomaly_report_text` if the escaped entity is now a local anomaly.
        *   `ship_integrity_pct`: If the failure/breach caused physical damage to the ship.
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the player's immediate, panicked response, e.g., "Wrestling Rogue Plasmatic Mop," "Attempting to Re-Jar Sentient Lavender Goo," "Consulting Dubious Emergency Protocols."
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 thematic, problem-solving (or problem-escalating) actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE.
    Examples (Failure): "Try hitting the mop with the Sarcastic Multi-Tool.", "Attempt to appease the mop with a heartfelt apology and a promise of better cleaning supplies.", "Consult the emergency manual's chapter on 'De-Sentientizing Overzealous Cleaning Implements'."
    Examples (Breach): "Use the emergency sonic broom to try and herd the goo back into a bucket.", "Attempt to communicate with the goo using only interpretive dance.", "Seal off the affected deck and hope it doesn't learn how to use the air vents."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `critical_system_failure_or_breach`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The failure/breach event has been narrated and its immediate effects described; the indicator is now reset. The *consequences* of the event will persist.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the player's current crisis-management activity from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators persist unless this crisis directly impacts them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your hilarious and chaotic narrative of the system failure or containment breach.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by this crisis.
    // Example: "plasmatic_mop_status_text": "Actively Hostile & Singing Show Tunes", "protocol_advice_text": "Emergency Mop Protocol 7.3: If mop sings, offer it a recording contract.", "activity_status": "Negotiating Terms with Operatic Mop"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a direct attempt to mitigate the disaster in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - a more creative or desperate approach in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - perhaps consulting the newly activated emergency protocols, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "critical_system_failure_or_breach": false, "activity_status": "Experiencing Technical Difficulties (And Existential Dread)."
    "critical_system_failure_or_breach": false // Mandatory: reset the flag.
  }
}

This is a prime opportunity for physical comedy and absurd problem-solving. The player should feel like they're in an episode of a sci-fi sitcom where everything that can go wrong, does, but in the funniest way possible.
