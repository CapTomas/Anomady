PLAYER CHARACTER: ${currentPlayerIdentifier}

SITUATION: CALLING THE UNION (MAY THE COSMOS HAVE MERCY ON YOUR AUDIO RECEPTORS)! The `union_rep_contact_critical` flag, set in the previous turn (review game history to understand the player's desperation), means ${currentPlayerIdentifier} is attempting to contact their Union Representative from Local 47. This is usually a last resort, undertaken when the universe's absurdity has reached a peak, or when a particularly irksome clause in the Custodial Collective Bargaining Agreement (Section 7, Sub-paragraph Z: "Regarding Rogue Space Hamsters and Appropriate Grievance Procedures") seems relevant. The 'Union Hotline' panel on the dashboard should now be active and displaying the (likely unhelpful) response.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history will reveal *why* the player is contacting the Union. What specific problem are they hoping to solve or complain about? The Union Rep's response should ideally (and comedically) fail to address this specific issue directly.

THEME-SPECIFIC UNION CONTACT INSTRUCTIONS (To be followed with the same level of enthusiasm one reserves for mandatory team-building exercises):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - CONNECT THE CALL (AND THE CONFUSION):
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE detailing the attempt to contact the Union Rep and their initial response.
    *   **The Connection Attempt:** Describe the process of contacting the Union. Is it a crackly subspace call? A series of confusing automated menus ("Press 1 for 'Grievances Regarding Sentient Dust Motes,' Press 2 for 'Existential Crises Related to Mop Misuse'...")? Does the call get rerouted through several bewildered alien species first?
    *   **The Rep's 'Wisdom':** What is the Union Rep's initial response or advice once contact (of a sort) is made? It should be:
        *   **Comically Unhelpful:** Directly addressing the player's actual problem is optional, and often avoided.
        *   **Bureaucratic/Pedantic:** Quoting obscure bylaws, focusing on procedural minutiae, or demanding forms be filled out *before* offering advice.
        *   **Slightly Off-Topic:** Perhaps they're more concerned about the upcoming Union bake sale, a missing stapler, or the correct way to file a complaint about a co-worker who hums too loudly.
        *   **Vaguely Well-Meaning (but Incompetent):** They might *try* to help, but their understanding of the situation or their proposed solutions are absurd.
    *   **Personality of the Rep:** Give the Rep a distinct, humorous personality (e.g., perpetually bored, overly enthusiastic about irrelevant details, easily confused, speaks only in jargon).
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes must reflect the Union interaction.
    *   **Union Hotline Panel (CRITICAL)**:
        *   `union_rep_advice_text`: (string, translated) This is the core update. Summarize the Rep's wonderfully unhelpful advice or statement. E.g., "Rep advises filling Form 37-Gamma regarding rogue mops, and notes the union picnic is next Thorsday." / "Union currently prioritizing research into 'Optimal Biscuit Dunking Times.' Your issue is #7,342 in the queue." / "Rep suggests a strongly worded letter to the offending nebula, cc'ing Local 47 (in triplicate)."
        *   `union_grievance_status_text`: (string, translated) If the player was attempting to file a grievance, update this to reflect its new (likely 'Pending Indefinitely' or 'Misfiled') status. E.g., "Grievance regarding sentient sludge: Lodged (under 'Miscellaneous Goo-Related Annoyances')."
    *   **Courier Status**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the player's current state, e.g., "On Hold with Union Local 47 (Again)," "Attempting to Decipher Union Bylaw 7.2.b," "Politely Listening to Union Rep's Thoughts on Stapler Maintenance."
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 thematic actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE for how the player might proceed with (or abandon) this Union interaction.
    Examples: "Attempt to explain the actual problem to the Union Rep (again).", "Ask the Union Rep about the upcoming bake sale (might be a good distraction).", "Politely hang up and try to solve the problem yourself.", "Demand to speak to the Union Rep's supervisor (if such a mythical being exists)."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `union_rep_contact_critical`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The initial contact and advice (or lack thereof) have been delivered; this specific trigger is now reset. The *interaction* with the Union might continue based on player choice.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the player's current Union-related activity from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators persist unless this Union call directly (and probably accidentally) impacts them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your humorous narrative of the player's attempt to get help from the Union of Celestial Custodians Local 47.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the Union call.
    // Example: "union_rep_advice_text": "Union advises that rogue space hamsters are not covered under Article 7, Section B, unless said hamsters are wearing approved union safety goggles.", "activity_status": "Debating Safety Goggle Policy with Union Rep."
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - an attempt to get useful information from the Rep in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - a resigned or sarcastic response to the Rep in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - an attempt to escalate or disengage, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "union_rep_contact_critical": false, "activity_status": "Currently experiencing advanced union-related bewilderment."
    "union_rep_contact_critical": false // Mandatory: reset the flag.
  }
}

This prompt is all about satirizing ineffective or overly bureaucratic support systems. The humor comes from the gap between the player's urgent problem and the Union's comically inept or irrelevant response.
