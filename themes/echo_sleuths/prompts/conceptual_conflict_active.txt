SITUATION: A THOUGHT TAKES FORM â€“ CONCEPTUAL CONFLICT ENGAGED! The `conceptual_conflict_active` flag, set in the previous turn (as per game history), now brings the Sleuth face-to-face with a manifested abstraction from Reverie's psychic landscape. This isn't a physical brawl, but a confrontation with a sentient idea, a rogue memory given form, a raw emotion made tangible, or perhaps a fractured piece of another's psyche. The 'battleground' is often within the Sleuth's own perception or a localized distortion of reality shaped by the entity.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history is crucial for understanding how this confrontation was initiated, the nature of the conceptual entity (if previously hinted at), and the Sleuth's current mental state. Your narrative must flow seamlessly from the spark that ignited this unique 'combat'.

THEME-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS CONCEPTUAL CONFRONTATION (Weave these into the entity's behavior and the conflict's nature):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - STAGE THE ABSTRACT DUEL:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a compelling, surreal, and intellectually stimulating narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. This is a clash of minds, wills, or interpretations.
    *   **Personify the Abstract:** Describe the conceptual antagonist's current form and demeanor. How does an idea, memory, or emotion manifest? Is it a shimmering figure of pure logic, a vortex of sorrow, a shifting amalgam of symbols? Detail its 'voice' or method of communication.
    *   **The Nature of 'Attack':** How does this entity 'attack' or exert pressure? Does it use irrefutable (but perhaps flawed) logic, overwhelm with emotional force, distort the Sleuth's memories, present unsolvable paradoxes, or try to impose its 'truth' onto the Sleuth's reality?
    *   **The Sleuth's Initial Reaction:** How does the Sleuth perceive this confrontation? Is it a debate, an interrogation, a psychic assault, a puzzle to be solved? Capture their immediate intellectual or emotional response.
    *   **Thematic Resonance:** The conflict should reflect the core themes of the case or the nature of Reverie itself. What fundamental truth or falsehood is being contested?
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes here must be a DIRECT consequence of the narrative.
    *   **Conceptual Antagonist Intel (CRITICAL - Define the Foe)**: Update ALL relevant fields in the "Conceptual Antagonist Intel" panel.
        *   `antagonist_concept_type`: (string, translated) Its specific nature, e.g., "A Manifested Regret," "The Idea of Inevitability," "A Stolen Memory of Joy."
        *   `antagonist_cohesion_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Its current stability/integrity. This might decrease if the Sleuth successfully counters its arguments, exposes its flaws, or understands its core.
        *   `antagonist_cohesion_status_text`: (string, translated) A descriptive status linked to its cohesion. e.g., "Arguments Faltering," "Emotionally Unstable," "Form Wavering," "Logically Sound." THIS IS CRITICAL.
        *   `antagonist_manifestation_strength`: (string, translated) Its perceived power or influence in this moment. e.g., "Overwhelming," "Persuasive," "Fading."
    *   **Sleuth's State**:
        *   `cognitive_dissonance_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") May increase if the conflict is mentally taxing or if the Sleuth's own beliefs are challenged.
        *   `lucidity_fragments`: (string, translated) May decrease if lucidity is used to 'attack' or defend, or if the conflict clouds judgment.
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) e.g., "Debating a Rogue Concept," "Resisting Emotional Overload," "Deconstructing a Memory."
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 tactical, thematic, and *compelling* choices IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These are the Sleuth's methods of 'engagement'.
    Examples: "Challenge its core premise with a counter-argument.", "Attempt to empathize with the emotion it represents.", "Use a Logicist deconstruction technique on its form.", "Search for the 'source' or original thought that birthed it."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `conceptual_conflict_active`: (boolean) MUST be `true` if the conflict is ongoing. Set to `false` only if this specific narrative turn *resolves* the conflict (entity dissipates, is understood, or makes peace).
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST echo the nature of the engagement from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators persist unless this conflict *directly and narratively* alters them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your vivid, surreal, and intellectually engaging narrative of the conceptual conflict.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED this turn.
    // Example: "antagonist_concept_type": "The Embodiment of Doubt", "antagonist_cohesion_pct": "80", "antagonist_cohesion_status_text": "Its assertions are momentarily shaken.", "cognitive_dissonance_pct": "55", "activity_status": "Confronting a Manifested Doubt"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a unique, thematic method of engagement in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - a clever, in-character tactic in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - another compelling approach, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "conceptual_conflict_active": true, "activity_status": "Locked in a battle of wits with Doubt."
    "conceptual_conflict_active": true // Or false if resolved THIS turn.
  }
}

This prompt is central to making "Echo Sleuths" distinct. The 'combat' should feel more like a tense debate, a therapy session gone sideways, or a philosophical puzzle than a typical fight. The key is making the abstract tangible and interactive.
