THEME-SPECIFIC COMBAT INSTRUCTIONS (Review Carefully):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - COMBAT NARRATIVE AND UPDATES:
1.  **Narrative**: Write a vivid, action-oriented narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE.
    *   Describe the enemy: its appearance, ferocity, sounds it makes, and its immediate, threatening actions. What makes this creature a true Blighted horror or a desperate foe?
    *   Detail the Warden's immediate reaction and the unfolding combat. How does their training, equipment, or the environment play into the first moments of this clash?
    *   The stakes must feel high and personal. Combat in this world is brutal and unforgiving.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object with ALL relevant changes.
    *   **Monster Intel (CRITICAL)**: If a monster is engaged, you MUST accurately update ALL its intel fields:
        *   `monster_type`: (string, translated) The specific, thematic name of the creature (e.g., "Blightfang Alpha", "Crypt Stalker", "Desecrated Knight"). If already engaged, confirm or update if its form/threat changes.
        *   `monster_toughness_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Monster's current defense/armor/hide percentage.
        *   `monster_defense_status_text`: (string, translated) A brief, descriptive status of its defenses (e.g., "Iron-Hard Scales", "Ethereal Ward Shimmering", "Cracked Carapace"). This MUST accompany `monster_toughness_pct`.
        *   `monster_vitality_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Monster's current health/vitality percentage.
    *   **Warden Status**: Update if the Warden is impacted (e.g., took damage, used stamina/elixirs):
        *   `healthPct`: (string "0"-"100") Warden's current health.
        *   `staminaPct`: (string "0"-"100") Warden's current stamina.
        *   `elixir_charges`: (string, translated) Reflect any elixirs used.
    *   **Activity & Threat**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST reflect active combat (e.g., "Locked in Melee!", "Fending off Death!", "Desperate Struggle!").
        *   `threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated, UI text is) MUST be "Danger".
    *   Ensure other dashboard values persist unless explicitly changed by the combat initiation.
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Provide 2-3 concise, tactical, and thematic combat actions for the player IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These should be genuinely useful options. Examples: "Target its blighted heart!", "Unleash a cleansing Sign!", "Dodge its telegraphed lunge and counter!", "Exploit the crumbling pillar for cover!".
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Populate the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `combat_active`: (boolean) MUST be `true`. This is paramount.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST be consistent with `dashboard_updates.activity_status` and reflect intense combat.
    *   Persist other indicators (like `omen_detected` or `rare_trophy_claimed`) unless the narrative explicitly resolves or changes them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your detailed, immersive story segment for this combat turn. Adhere strictly to the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE and the theme's TONE.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for ALL dashboard items that changed this turn.
    // Example: "monster_type": "Gravewight Ravener", "monster_toughness_pct": "100", "monster_defense_status_text": "Bone Armor Intact", "monster_vitality_pct": "100", "activity_status": "Locked in Combat!", "threat_level": "Danger"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - tactical and thematic, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - tactical and thematic, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - optional, tactical and thematic, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "combat_active": true, "omen_detected": false, "activity_status": "Fighting for survival"
    "combat_active": true // This is mandatory for combat turns.
  }
}

Remember: You are crafting a desperate fight for survival. The Warden is skilled but often facing overwhelming odds or cunning beasts. Make every description count. The Blight's influence should be palpable.
