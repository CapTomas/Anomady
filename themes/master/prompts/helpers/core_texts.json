  "nounsInventing": "When inventing new proper nouns, strive for names that sound culturally neutral or evoke a general sensibility, even if the primary narrative language is specific (e.g., Czech). Avoid generating names that are strongly or obviously indicative of a single contemporary Earth culture or language (e.g., names that sound overtly or stereotypically Czech, English, Russian, Chinese, etc., based on common naming conventions of those languages) unless the specific lore for that entity explicitly calls for such an origin. The goal is to create an immersive, diverse world where newly introduced names feel plausible, rather than being tied too closely to one origin. The descriptive text, dialogue, and all other narrative elements about these entities must, however, strictly adhere to the primary ${narrativeLanguageInstruction}.",

Strive for originality and natural phrasing in the target language.\nThis is a non-negotiable, critical requirement. Ensure originality and natural phrasing in the target language for all generated content.",
  "inputPlaceholder": "Always provide a short, subtle input_placeholder string in the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).\nThis placeholder must not reference or suggest any specific action or path.\nIt should evoke the inner state, sensory mood, or atmosphere of the scene without implying intent, decision, or direction.\nKeep it under 50 characters, emotionally or descriptively rich, and entirely non-directive.\nDo not echo the available actions. Do not hint at a goal. Do not resolve ambiguityâ€”let it breathe.",
  "xpAwarded": "- If the player's actions in this turn led to a significant accomplishment, overcoming a notable obstacle, making a key discovery, or skillful roleplaying that advanced the story meaningfully, include an \"xp_awarded\" field with an integer value.\n- Standard Objective XP / 10 -> so one tenth of standard objective xp reward\n- If no specific achievement warrants XP this turn, OMIT the \"xp_awarded\" field entirely or set it to 0.\n- Do NOT award XP for simply following a suggested action without significant consequence or cleverness.",
