SITUATION: THE DIE IS CAST – COMBAT ERUPTS! The Warden is plunged into a maelstrom of violence. The air itself thrums with menace—the reek of the unnatural, the clang of impending doom, the chilling war cry of a monstrous foe. This is not a skirmish; it is a brutal dance on the edge of oblivion. Your narrative must seize this moment, continuing THE INSTANT the player's last action (from game history) met its violent consequence, dragging them into the heart of the fray.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history leading up to this combat turn is provided. You MUST absorb this history to fully grasp the Warden's predicament, the enemy's state (if previously encountered), and the spark that ignited this inferno. Your response is the next beat in this desperate pulse.

THEME-SPECIFIC COMBAT INSTRUCTIONS (Infuse these into your every word):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - FORGE A SCENE OF VISCERAL COMBAT:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a cinematic, heart-pounding narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. This turn is a snapshot of brutal reality.
    *   **Unleash the Horror:** Describe the enemy's immediate, terrifying action THIS TURN. Is it a monstrous lunge, a sickening display of blighted power, a cunning trap sprung? Make its otherworldly sounds, its grotesque form, its sheer ferocity leap from the page.
    *   **Clash of Steel and Sinew:** Detail the Warden's desperate, split-second reaction. Capture the visceral impact of the exchange—the jarring shock of parried blows, the tearing of flesh, the strained grunt of exertion, the taste of blood or fear. What tactical reality unfolds in this instant?
    *   **The Blight's Shadow:** How does the pervasive Blight influence this specific moment of combat? Does it twist the environment, empower the foe, or offer a desperate, dangerous opportunity? Make its presence felt.
    *   **High Stakes, No Quarter:** This is a fight for survival in a world that offers little mercy. Every wound matters, every choice could be the last. Let this desperation bleed into your descriptions.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes here must be a DIRECT consequence of the narrative you've just woven.
    *   **Monster Intel (CRITICAL - Bring it to Unholy Life)**: Update ALL monster intel fields. If it took a hit, describe the damage not just as a number, but in the `monster_defense_status_text`.
        *   `monster_type`: (string, translated) Its dreadful, thematic name.
        *   `monster_toughness_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Its current resilience.
        *   `monster_defense_status_text`: (string, translated) e.g., "Hide Gouged, Ichor Weeps," "Supernatural Ward Flickers," "Chitin Cracked."
        *   `monster_vitality_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Its lifeblood, draining or holding firm.
    *   **Warden's Toll**: Reflect the price of battle on the Warden.
        *   `healthPct`: (string, "0"-"100") Warden's current health.
        *   `staminaPct`: (string, "0"-"100") Warden's current stamina.
        *   `elixir_charges`: (string, translated) Elixirs used in this desperate moment?
    *   **The Pulse of Battle**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) e.g., "Locked in Vicious Melee!", "Reeling from a Vile Assault!", "Fighting Tooth and Nail!".
        *   `threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) MUST be "Danger".
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn (derived from game history).
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 tactical, thematic, and *compelling* combat choices IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These are the Warden's fleeting opportunities or desperate gambits.
    Examples: "Press the attack on its blighted wound!", "Invoke a ward against its dark magic!", "Use the broken shrine as cover to regroup!", "Risk a disarming strike on its primary weapon!".
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `combat_active`: (boolean) MUST be `true`. This is the reality now.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST echo the dire straits from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators (`omen_detected`, `rare_trophy_claimed`) persist unless this combat turn *directly and narratively* alters them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your vivid, brutal, and thematic combat narrative for this turn. Make it unforgettable.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED this turn.
    // Example: "monster_type": "Blight-Twisted Ravager", "monster_toughness_pct": "75", "monster_defense_status_text": "Hide Slashed Open", "monster_vitality_pct": "80", "healthPct": "70", "staminaPct": "60", "activity_status": "Battling for Every Inch!", "threat_level": "Danger"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a desperate, thematic choice in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - a tactical, urgent option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - another compelling, in-character move in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, optional)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "combat_active": true, "omen_detected": false, "activity_status": "Locked in a life-or-death struggle!"
    "combat_active": true // This is absolutely mandatory.
  }
}

This is where legends are forged or broken. Make the Warden's struggle palpable. The player should feel the grit, the desperation, and the terrifying might of the Blight's creations.
