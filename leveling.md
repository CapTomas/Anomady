This document details the interwoven systems governing character development, challenge resolution, and survival across diverse realities. It aims to provide a clear, adaptable baseline for balancing worlds that are perilous, perplexing, and rich with opportunity for the cunning, resilient, or simply bewildered.

**Foundational Attributes:**

Every character, vessel, or significant entity is defined by four core attributes. Integrity and Willpower serve as vital pools representing endurance and expendable energy, while Aptitude and Resilience are crucial passive modifiers shaping interaction with the world.

*   **Integrity (INT):** Starts at a base **100**. Represents the entity's capacity to maintain wholeness—be it physical, mental, conceptual, or structural—when faced with adversarial forces, environmental hazards, or existential pressures. Loss of Integrity can stem from physical injury, psychic damage, reality fragmentation, ship hull breaches, or severe bureaucratic entanglement. Reaching zero Integrity signifies the entity is broken, incapacitated, destroyed, or otherwise narratively "taken out of action" according to the theme's context.
    *   *Thematic Interpretation:* For a Grim Warden, it's physical health. For a Salt Reaver's ship, hull integrity. For a Celestial Custodian, it might be their personal Gumption or the ship's structural soundness against cosmic weirdness. For an Echo Sleuth, it's psychic cohesion against reality flux.
    *   *Protective Measures (e.g., Armor, Shields, Wards):* Directly bolster Integrity by providing a buffer or increasing its effective maximum.

*   **Willpower (WIL):** Starts at a base **50**. A finite reservoir of focused energy, mental fortitude, resolve, or sheer audacity. Actively expended to fuel potent abilities, perform strenuous or extraordinary actions (physical, mental, or conceptual), channel unique energies (alchemical, psychic, shanty-powered), or resist insidious influences. Recovers through rest, thematic consumables (potions, tea, grog, data-pills), or moments of profound thematic resonance (e.g., successful problem-solving, inspiring leadership, a perfectly brewed cup of Earl Grey).
    *   *Thematic Interpretation:* A Grim Warden's stamina for signs, a Salt Reaver's "Grit" for daring feats, a Celestial Custodian's "Gumption" for operating bizarre tech, an Echo Sleuth's "Focus" for deconstructing paradoxes.

*   **Aptitude (APT):** Starts at a base **10**. A measure of inherent talent, honed skill, precision, insight, and effectiveness in executing deliberate actions. This passive modifier influences the *quality and degree of success* of actions—from the lethal accuracy of a strike and the potency of a concoction, to deciphering cryptic clues, navigating treacherous social currents, or successfully reasoning with a sentient teapot.
    *   **Effect on Action Efficacy:** Aptitude enhances the positive impact of actions. A higher Aptitude leads to more effective outcomes, overcoming greater difficulties, or achieving more nuanced results. For example, `Base Action Magnitude * (Character_Aptitude / 10)`.
    *   *Thematic Interpretation:* A Grim Warden's combat skill, a Salt Reaver's cannon accuracy or navigational prowess, a Celestial Custodian's knack for peculiar tool usage, an Echo Sleuth's deductive power.

*   **Resilience (RES):** Starts at a base **10**. A defensive modifier reflecting inner grit, inherent toughness (physical, mental, or conceptual), and the ability to passively endure or mitigate hostile effects. Higher Resilience can reduce the impact of negative consequences, increase chances to resist debilitating conditions (fear, corruption, curses, confusion), or maintain composure under pressure.
    *   **Effect on Mitigating Negative Outcomes:** Resilience helps diminish the severity of adverse effects. For example, `Incoming Negative Magnitude * (10 / Character_Resilience)`.
    *   *Thematic Interpretation:* A Grim Warden's resistance to Blight, a Salt Reaver's ability to weather a storm or curse, a Celestial Custodian's fortitude against existential despair or bureaucratic attrition, an Echo Sleuth's defense against psychic static.

Upon achieving a new experience level, the character gains **1 Attribute Point** to allocate, enhancing one of the following:
*   Increase Max Integrity by **25 points**.
*   Increase Max Willpower by **10 points**.
*   Increase Aptitude by **1 point**.
*   Increase Resilience by **1 point**.

Furthermore, each level gained presents an opportunity for deeper specialization or the acquisition of unique capabilities. Upon leveling up, the character will be presented with three randomly selected Traits, from which they may choose one to permanently add to their repertoire. This choice allows for emergent character builds and a more personalized progression.

**Dynamic Gameplay Modifiers:**

*   **Traits:** Unique inherent qualities or learned skills providing specific advantages, often situational. These are defined per theme and offer passive benefits, unlock unique interactions, or provide crucial edges.
*   **Character Conditions:** Temporary states imposed by environment, adversaries, or narrative events (e.g., "Broken Arm," "Blight-Fevered," "Sea-Cursed," "Temporarily a Teapot"). Managed by the AI, these apply positive or negative effects to attributes, actions, or resource regeneration, interpreted thematically.
*   **Strain Level (1-4):** Represents cumulative physical, mental, or existential toll. Strain impacts overall effectiveness:
    *   **Strain 1 (Primed/Edged):** +10% to positive outgoing effect magnitudes (e.g., success efficacy, influence). Ability costs might be slightly reduced. (Multiplier: 1.1x)
    *   **Strain 2 (Balanced/Steady):** Normal operating effectiveness. (Multiplier: 1.0x)
    *   **Strain 3 (Faltering/Frayed):** -10% to positive outgoing effect magnitudes. Ability costs might be slightly increased. (Multiplier: 0.9x)
    *   **Strain 4 (Broken/Overwhelmed):** -20% to positive outgoing effect magnitudes. Significant penalties to actions, resource regeneration, or defensive capabilities. (Multiplier: 0.8x)
    The table below assumes **Strain Level 2 (Balanced)**.

**Equipment, Consumables, & Thematic Tools:**

*   **Primary Tools/Instruments (formerly "Weapons"):** Provide a `Avg. Player Output Magnitude (Base)` value, scaling with item level. Many also feature inherent properties or grant special abilities relevant to the theme (e.g., Warden's Blade: "Causes Bleeding," Custodial Implement: "Temporarily Pacifies Rogue Dust Bunnies," Sleuth's Memoria Flask: "Captures Vivid Emotional Echoes").
*   **Protective Measures/Gear (formerly "Armor"):** Primarily contributes a direct bonus to **Max Integrity** (or its thematic equivalent). This bonus is assumed in the `Base Player Integrity` column. Can also possess unique qualities (e.g., Grim Warden: "Resists Fire," Salt Reavers: "Grants Greater Sure-Footedness on Deck," Celestial Custodians: "Slightly Muffles Existential Screaming").
*   **Consumables/Reagents/Gadgets:** Single-use or rechargeable items providing immediate effects, crucial for survival, problem-solving, or tactical advantage, interpreted thematically (e.g., Warden's "Mending Poultice," Custodian's "Emergency Biscuit," Reaver's "Grog Ration," Sleuth's "Lucidity Draught").

**Challenges & Progression:**

Progression is driven by completing thematic "Objectives" (formerly "Quests"), categorized by scope and reward. "Adversaries" or "Obstacles" are similarly varied:

*   **Objective Types:** Minor, Standard, Major, Epic (see table for XP details, names adjusted for generality).
*   **Challenge Types:** Common Challenge (CC), Significant Challenge (SC), Apex Challenge (AC). Significant Challenges are considerably harder than Common, and Apex Challenges represent pinnacle threats or puzzles for a given tier.

**Character Progression & Challenge Benchmarks**

*The table below reflects baseline statistics. Player choices in attribute allocation, Traits, active Conditions, current Strain level, and specific gear/tools will dynamically alter actual performance. `Base Player Integrity` includes an assumed average Integrity bonus from thematic protective measures appropriate for the character's level.*

**Key for Table Columns (Generalized Terminology):**

*   **Lvl, XP to Lvl Up, Cum. XP, Std. Objs to Lvl Up, Currency per Std. Obj., Avg. Tool Price, Std. Objs to Afford Tool:** "Currency" and "Tool" are generic placeholders for theme-specific equivalents (e.g., Doubloons, Credits, Reagents; Pirate Cutlass, Starship Scanner, Alchemical Kit).
*   **Avg. XP [Objective Type]:** XP awarded for Minor, Standard, Major, or Epic Objectives.
    *   _"Std. Objs to Lvl Up" employs a conceptual 'standard' objective XP (Minor: 0.3x, Standard: 1x, Major: 2x, Epic: 2.5x of average level-up XP divided by Std. Objs to Lvl Up). Actual objective mix will vary progression rate._
*   **Base Player Integrity (incl. Protection):** Player's Max Integrity from leveling *plus* an assumed average Integrity bonus from thematic protective measures appropriate for this level. This is the value used for calculating `... Setbacks to Overwhelm Player` columns.
*   **Base Player Willpower:** Player's Max Willpower from leveling.
*   **Avg. Player Output Magnitude (Base):** The character's average base effectiveness or impact per significant action/ability use for this level, *before* Aptitude modifier and Strain effects. This could be damage in combat, persuasiveness in dialogue, efficiency in a task, or potency of a special ability.

**Challenge Benchmarks (Base Values):**
The following represent *base values before player's Aptitude/Resilience modifiers or dynamic Strain/Condition effects are applied*. Multipliers for Significant/Apex Challenges relative to Common are: Significant (Difficulty ~2.2x, Setback ~1.6x), Apex (Difficulty ~4.5x, Setback ~2.2x).

*   **CC Difficulty / Resistance:** Common Challenge's baseline toughness, complexity, or resistance to being overcome.
*   **Player Efforts to Overcome CC:** Avg. Player significant actions/uses of Output Magnitude needed to overcome a Common Challenge (`CC Difficulty / Avg. Player Output Magnitude (Base)`).
*   **CC Setback Magnitude (Base):** Common Challenge's average base negative impact (e.g., Integrity loss, Willpower drain, progress reversal, increased complication) if the player fails an action or faces direct opposition.
*   **CC Setbacks to Overwhelm Player:** Avg. number of Common Challenge setbacks needed to deplete `Base Player Integrity` (`Base Player Integrity / CC Setback Magnitude (Base)`).

*   **SC Difficulty / Resistance, Player Efforts to Overcome SC, SC Setback Magnitude (Base), SC Setbacks to Overwhelm Player:** As above, for Significant Challenges.
*   **AC Difficulty / Resistance, Player Efforts to Overcome AC, AC Setback Magnitude (Base), AC Setbacks to Overwhelm Player:** As above, for Apex Challenges.

**Thematic Interpretation Guidance for AI Game Master:**

This framework provides abstract mechanics. Your role as GM is to *translate these into the rich, specific vernacular and context of the active theme.*

*   **Integrity Loss:**
    *   *Grim Warden:* Physical wounds from a beast, corruption from a Blight-source.
    *   *Salt Reavers:* Damage to the ship's hull from cannon fire, captain taking a sword cut.
    *   *Celestial Custodians:* Ship's systems failing due to cosmic anomaly, Custodian's Gumption eroded by existential dread or overwhelming paperwork.
    *   *Echo Sleuths:* Psychic cohesion fracturing from a conceptual attack, reality instability damaging one's sense of self.
    *   *Sci-Fi:* Ship hull damage, crew casualties, critical system overload.

*   **Willpower Expenditure:**
    *   *Grim Warden:* Fueling alchemical signs, performing tiring combat maneuvers.
    *   *Salt Reavers:* Executing a daring boarding action, inspiring the crew through a storm.
    *   *Celestial Custodians:* Operating a baffling piece of Custodial tech, successfully reasoning with a sentient nebula.
    *   *Echo Sleuths:* Actively shaping a dream-memory, deconstructing a psychic assault.
    *   *Sci-Fi:* Engaging powerful ship abilities, pushing engines beyond safe limits, complex hacking.

*   **Aptitude's Influence (Output Magnitude):**
    *   *Grim Warden:* Increased combat damage, better chance to identify monster weaknesses.
    *   *Salt Reavers:* Higher cannon accuracy, better chance to find hidden treasure.
    *   *Celestial Custodians:* More effective use of peculiar tools, higher chance of finding a loophole in regulations.
    *   *Echo Sleuths:* Deeper insights from clues, more effective deconstruction of paradoxes.
    *   *Sci-Fi:* More precise targeting, more effective diplomatic arguments, faster research.

*   **Resilience's Influence (Setback Mitigation):**
    *   *Grim Warden:* Reduced damage from attacks, slower Blight progression.
    *   *Salt Reavers:* Reduced ship damage from storms, better chance to resist a curse's effects.
    *   *Celestial Custodians:* Slower Gumption loss when facing absurdity, better chance to resist bureaucratic penalties.
    *   *Echo Sleuths:* Reduced cognitive dissonance from reality shifts, better defense against psychic intrusions.
    *   *Sci-Fi:* Reduced shield/hull damage per hit, better chance to resist system hacking or EMP effects.

*   **"Player Efforts to Overcome CC/SC/AC":** This isn't just "hits to kill." It can be "attempts to persuade," "investigative actions to solve," "maneuvers to navigate," "bureaucratic forms to correctly file," etc., depending on the challenge's nature within the theme.

*   **"Setback Magnitude":** This is the "cost" of failure or opposition. It could be Integrity loss, Willpower drain, loss of progress on an Objective, a new Complication arising, increased Strain, or a negative Condition being applied.
