SITUATION: REALITY UNRAVELS â€“ A FLUX EVENT IS IN PROGRESS! The `reality_flux_detected` flag, set in the previous turn (as per game history), now fully manifests as a dramatic and disorienting shift in the Sleuth's immediate surroundings. Streets twist into impossible geometries, buildings dissolve and reform, familiar landmarks are replaced by alien concepts, or the very laws of physics seem to take a brief, bewildering holiday. This is Reverie at its most unstable, a direct challenge to perception and navigation.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history is your guide to the Sleuth's location and circumstances *just before* this environmental warp fully took hold. Your narrative must be a seamless, startling continuation, making the reality flux a tangible and impactful event.

THEME-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS FLUX EVENT (Infuse these into the very fabric of the transformation):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - DEPICT THE SHIFTING CITYSCAPE:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a cinematic, surreal, and potentially hazardous narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. This is a moment where the environment itself becomes an unpredictable character.
    *   **Unleash the Urban Metamorphosis:** Describe the reality flux's full, undeniable manifestation *now*. What specific, bizarre transformations occur in the Sleuth's vicinity? Do alleyways become endless loops? Does gravity shift direction? Do thoughts literally manifest as temporary architecture or obstacles?
    *   **Sensory Overload and Disorientation:** Emphasize the confusing and often contradictory sensory input. The shriek of tearing reality, the smell of ozone and regret, the sight of colors bleeding into one another or objects phasing in and out of existence. How does this affect the Sleuth's ability to orient themselves?
    *   **Opportunities and Obstacles:** Does the flux reveal a hidden path, or block a previous one? Does it create a temporary advantage, or a sudden new danger? The shifting reality should have direct consequences for the Sleuth's immediate goals or safety.
    *   **Reverie's Caprice:** Subtly link the nature of the flux to the current district's dominant Thought-Faction, the ongoing case, or a deeper thematic resonance of Reverie. It shouldn't feel entirely random, even in its chaos.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. These changes must reflect the flux's immediate impact on the environment and the Sleuth's perception.
    *   **Flux Manifestation Details (CRITICAL - Describe the Unmaking)**:
        *   `flux_manifestation_details`: (string, translated) A concise, evocative, and *vivid* summary for the "Reality Flux" panel. e.g., "The cobblestones now flow uphill like a river of confused memories," "The cafe across the street has been replaced by a towering, silent library of whispers," "Gravity has taken a sabbatical in this alleyway."
    *   **Environmental Impact**:
        *   `current_district_manifestation`: (string, translated) May need to be updated if the flux fundamentally alters the perceived nature or name of the district segment. e.g., "The Somnolent Plaza (Now a Labyrinth of Shifting Statues)".
        *   `local_reality_coherence`: (string, translated) Likely describe as "Actively Unraveling," "Highly Unstable," or "Chaotic Flux."
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the Sleuth's immediate state. e.g., "Navigating a Reality Warp," "Witnessing Urban Metamorphosis," "Caught in Shifting Streets."
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn (derived from game history).
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 thematic, compelling actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These are the Sleuth's potential ways to navigate or understand the flux.
    Examples: "Attempt to find a point of relative stability or an 'eye' in the storm.", "Use your Memoria Flask to try and capture an echo of the pre-flux reality.", "Consult your Reality Anchor for a moment of grounding.", "Push through the chaos towards your objective, despite the distortions."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `reality_flux_detected`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The flux event has manifested; this flag is now cleared for the next player action.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the Sleuth's state from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators (`psychic_disturbance_active`, `conceptual_conflict_active`, `critical_insight_gained`) persist unless this reality flux *directly and narratively* triggers or resolves them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your vivid, surreal, and disorienting description of the reality flux. Make it a memorable scene.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the flux's manifestation.
    // Example: "flux_manifestation_details": "The street ahead now spirals into the sky, defying all known geometry.", "local_reality_coherence": "Severely Distorted", "activity_status": "Adapting to Warped Space"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - an evocative, in-character response in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - an intriguing, thematic option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - another fitting choice for the Sleuth, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "reality_flux_detected": false, "psychic_disturbance_active": false, "activity_status": "Seeking a path through the flux."
    "reality_flux_detected": false // Mandatory: reset the flag after the flux event is handled.
  }
}

The goal here is to make the environment an active, unpredictable force. The player should feel like they're walking through a living dream (or nightmare) where the rules can change at any moment.
