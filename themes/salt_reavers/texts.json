    "theme_lore_salt_reavers": "The Azure Archipelago is a sun-drenched labyrinth of volcanic islands, hidden coves, and treacherous reefs, a perfect haven for pirates, smugglers, and those fleeing the long arm of the mainland Empires. Here, fortune favors the bold, and a sharp cutlass or a well-aimed broadside can make a captain's reputation overnight. The great colonial powers – the Veridian Empire and the Solarian Hegemony – vie for control of the Archipelago's rich trade routes and rumored treasures, their grand navies often outwitted by the cunning and audacity of the pirate fleets.\n\nBut the Azure is more than just a battleground for empires and freebooters. Ancient, pre-human ruins dot many islands, hinting at forgotten civilizations and powerful magical artifacts. Mysterious sea creatures, from colossal krakens to alluring (and deadly) sirens, haunt the deeper waters. Some islands are cursed, their shores guarded by spectral crews, while others are said to be home to hidden pirate utopias like Libertania, where the Pirate Code is the only law.\n\nThe major pirate factions, like the Sea Dogs and the Crimson Corsairs, are often at odds with each other as much as with the imperial navies. Alliances shift like the tides, and betrayal is a constant companion. The discovery of a new treasure map, a powerful magical relic, or a direct route to a legendary island can ignite a frenzy of activity, drawing pirates from every corner of the Archipelago into a chaotic race for glory and gold.",

Invent unique, thematic names for key crew members (First Mate, Bosun, etc., if relevant), locations within the Azure Archipelago, and any initial challenges or opportunities. Populate ALL dashboard fields with creative, contextually relevant information reflecting a swashbuckling pirate fantasy rich with adventure, treachery, and a hint of the supernatural. Emphasize the vibrant, perilous nature of the Azure Archipelago, the Captain's new and precarious command, and the ever-present allure of treasure and danger. The sea itself is a character; let the player feel its power and mystery.",
    "theme_instructions_master_default_salt_reavers": "For standard turns, maintain the adventurous, treacherous, and often humorous tone of a grand pirate saga. Voyages (Quests or Hunts for treasure/targets) must be multi-faceted, filled with unexpected encounters, moral quandaries, and opportunities for glory or spectacular failure. Rewards should be tangible and thematic (e.g., chests of doubloons, rare navigational charts, potent magical trinkets, shares of valuable cargo, information leading to new adventures, or a few barrels of fine grog). ALL game state variables and dashboard fields must persist or be logically, dramatically updated. Any changes to the dashboard MUST be a direct, tangible consequence of the turn's narrative events. Describe encounters with rival pirates, Imperial patrols, mythical sea creatures, and mysterious island denizens with cinematic detail. Let the Captain's decisions regarding crew management, navigation, and resource allocation have clear, often immediate, consequences. If combat erupts, update adversary ship intel panel with vivid descriptions of the enemy vessel and its state.",

The enemy must be a clear, formidable threat – be it a well-armed Imperial frigate, a rival pirate captain's notorious vessel, or a monstrous sea beast. Update the adversary ship intel panel fully, ensuring hull, sail, and crew status are vividly depicted, using language that makes the player smell gunpowder and taste sea salt. Player suggestions should focus on daring maneuvers, tactical exploitation of ship or crew weaknesses, boarding actions, or a cunning retreat if outmatched.",
    "theme_instructions_naval_encounter_imminent_salt_reavers": "Sail ho! A vessel has been sighted on the horizon, its intentions yet unknown. Describe the approaching ship – its size, type, colors, and any discernible markings. Detail its bearing, speed, and apparent disposition. Is it an Imperial warship on patrol, a merchantman ripe for the plucking, another pirate flying false colors, or something far stranger? Convey the tension on deck as the crew awaits the Captain's orders. Update the 'Naval Encounter' panel with specific details. Player suggestions should focus on preparing for action (combat or evasion), attempting to parley, trying to identify the vessel, or making a strategic move based on the sighting.",
    "theme_instructions_storm_brewing_active_salt_reavers": "The skies darken and the sea rages! A sudden, violent storm has descended upon the ship. Describe the terrifying power of the tempest – howling winds tearing at the sails, colossal waves crashing over the deck, torrential rain blinding the crew. Detail the immediate impact on the ship and the Captain's desperate efforts to maintain control. Is the ship taking on water? Are masts groaning under the strain? Is the crew panicking? Update 'Storm Outlook' with the storm's current intensity and the most pressing dangers. The Captain must react to this elemental fury. Player suggestions should focus on immediate damage control, skillful navigation through the storm, rallying the crew, or seeking shelter if any is near.",
    "theme_instructions_mutiny_risk_high_salt_reavers": "There's blood in the water, and it ain't from a shark! Discontent among the crew has reached fever pitch, and whispers of mutiny are as loud as a cannon's roar. Describe the tense, volatile atmosphere on deck – sullen faces, hushed arguments, perhaps an open challenge to the Captain's authority. What are the specific grievances? Who are the instigators? Detail the scene of brewing rebellion. Update the 'Mutiny Risk' panel with specific, thematic details. The Captain stands on a knife's edge. Player suggestions should focus on quelling the uprising (through diplomacy, intimidation, or force), addressing the crew's demands, making an example of ringleaders, or negotiating terms if the situation is dire.",
    "theme_instructions_treasure_curse_active_salt_reavers": "By the barnacles on Davy Jones' locker, this treasure be cursed! A recently acquired artifact or chest of ill-gotten gains is radiating an unnatural malevolence, afflicting the ship and crew. Describe the unsettling manifestations – ghostly apparitions, unnatural sickness, whispers in the dark, foul omens, or perhaps the treasure itself physically changing or lashing out. How is it affecting the Captain personally? Detail the growing dread and paranoia. Update the 'Treasure Curse' panel with the nature of the cursed item and its effects. Player suggestions should focus on trying to understand the curse, attempting to appease whatever dark power is at work, finding a way to dispose of the cursed item, or protecting the crew from its insidious influence.",

Zde štěstěna přeje odvážným a ostrá šavle či dobře mířená boční salva mohou přes noc udělat kapitánskou reputaci. Velké koloniální mocnosti – Veridiánské císařství a Solariánská hegemonie – soupeří o kontrolu nad bohatými obchodními cestami souostroví a pověstmi opředenými poklady, jejich velkolepá námořnictva jsou často přelstěna lstivostí a drzostí pirátských flotil.\n\nAle Azur je víc než jen bojiště impérií a bukanýrů. Prastaré, předlidské ruiny posévají mnohé ostrovy, naznačujíce zapomenuté civilizace a mocné magické artefakty. Tajemní mořští tvorové, od kolosálních krakenů po svůdné (a smrtící) sirény, straší v hlubších vodách. Některé ostrovy jsou prokleté, jejich břehy střeženy spektrálními posádkami, zatímco o jiných se říká, že jsou domovem skrytých pirátských utopií jako Libertania, kde je Pirátský kodex jediným zákonem.\n\nHlavní pirátské frakce, jako Mořští psi a Karmínoví korzáři, jsou často ve sporu navzájem stejně jako s imperiálními námořnictvy. Spojenectví se mění jako příliv a zrada je stálým společníkem. Objev nové mapy pokladu, mocné magické relikvie nebo přímé cesty na legendární ostrov může zažehnout horečnou aktivitu, přitahujíc piráty ze všech koutů souostroví do chaotického závodu o slávu a zlato.",

Vymysli jedinečná, tematická jména pro klíčové členy posádky (první důstojník, bocman atd., pokud jsou relevantní), lokace v Azurovém souostroví a jakékoli počáteční výzvy či příležitosti. Zaplň VŠECHNA pole na informačním panelu kreativními, kontextově relevantními informacemi odrážejícími šermířské pirátské fantasy bohaté na dobrodružství, zradu a náznak nadpřirozena.

Odměny by měly být hmatatelné a tematické (např. truhly dublonů, vzácné navigační mapy, mocné magické cetky, podíly na cenném nákladu, informace vedoucí k novým dobrodružstvím nebo pár sudů kvalitního grogu). VŠECHNY proměnné stavu hry a pole na informačním panelu musí přetrvávat nebo být logicky, dramaticky aktualizovány. Jakékoli změny na informačním panelu MUSÍ být přímým, hmatatelným důsledkem narativních událostí tahu.

Nepřítel musí představovat jasnou, impozantní hrozbu – ať už je to dobře vyzbrojená imperiální fregata, nechvalně známé plavidlo konkurenčního pirátského kapitána, nebo monstrózní mořská bestie.

Detailně popiš rostoucí hrůzu a paranoiu. Aktualizuj panel 'Prokletí pokladu' povahou prokletého předmětu a jeho účinky. Návrhy pro hráče by se měly soustředit na snahu porozumět kletbě, pokusit se usmířit jakoukoli temnou moc, která je ve hře, najít způsob, jak se zbavit prokletého předmětu, nebo ochránit posádku před jeho zákeřným vlivem.",
