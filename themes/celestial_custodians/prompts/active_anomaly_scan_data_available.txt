SITUATION: "SKIPPY, DID THE SCANNER JUST... GIGGLE?" The `active_anomaly_scan_data_available` flag, nudged into existence in the previous turn (peruse game history for the thrilling lead-up!), signifies that the ship's Local Peculiarity Monitor has just registered something... noteworthy. And by 'noteworthy,' we mean something that would make a seasoned theoretical physicist weep into their tea. This isn't necessarily a creature, but some delightful environmental quirk, a spatial distortion with questionable fashion sense, a bizarre energy reading that hums slightly off-key, or a general outbreak of localized cosmic weirdness that positively *demands* a confused stare, possibly followed by a cautious poke with a long, non-conductive custodial implement. The 'Local Peculiarity Monitor' panel on the dashboard should now be active, bravely attempting to display this new, baffling information.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history sets the stage prior to this peculiar ping. Was the area deceptively normal, lulling the Custodian into a false sense of 'this might actually be a straightforward job'? Or was it already a bit odd, and this is just the universe doubling down on its commitment to absurdity? This new data should introduce a fresh layer of glorious peculiarity or a specific, tangible focal point for the ongoing weirdness.

THEME-SPECIFIC ANOMALY INSTRUCTIONS (To be interpreted with the same scientific rigor one applies to determining the optimal dunking time for a particularly stubborn biscuit in zero gravity):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - REPORT THE UTTERLY BAFFLING FINDINGS WITH SCIENTIFIC (ISH) DETACHMENT:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft a narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE that introduces this new anomaly with a perfect blend of scientific bewilderment and understated panic.
    *   **The Scanner's Startling Revelation (Or Polite Cough):** How does the player become aware of this new, excitingly confusing scan data? Does the scanner terminal make a noise like a surprised kazoo? Does the ship's AI, Skippy, announce it with undue enthusiasm for potential disaster, or perhaps with profound, existential confusion that mirrors the anomaly itself?
    *   **Behold! The Anomaly (In All Its Mind-Bending Glory):** What specific, wondrously strange phenomenon has been detected? Don't just state it; *paint it with words*.
        *   *Examples (to spark your AI imagination, not to be copied verbatim):* "The scanner reports, with what can only be described as digital reluctance, a localized outbreak of spontaneous, aggressively cheerful polka music emanating from that suspiciously quiet asteroid cluster. Early readings suggest a worrying lack of accordions." / "Sensors indicate a nearby nebula is currently experiencing a severe case of existential indecision, causing it to flicker erratically between seven distinct shades of regret and three entirely new states of matter that defy all known classification (and possibly good taste)." / "A concentrated field of 'hyper-efficient politeness' temporal distortion has been detected just off the port bow; objects (and unfortunate space-moths) entering it apologize profusely for their intrusion before ceasing to exist in the current timeframe, often leaving behind tiny, exquisitely handwritten thank-you notes." / "The immediate area is saturated with unusually high levels of 'narrative convenience particles,' which may explain why you just found that lost sock."
    *   **Sensory Details (Or Lack Thereof, Which Is Also Weird) & Initial Impact:** What does this anomaly look, sound, smell, or *feel* like (if such mundane senses even apply)? Does it have any immediate, minor, and probably humorous effects on the ship, its systems, or the Custodian's rapidly dwindling supply of Gumption?
    *   **A Puzzling Invitation to Investigate:** The anomaly should be deeply intriguing, perhaps a bit baffling, but not necessarily an immediate, overwhelming physical threat. It's a cosmic oddity, a puzzle box wrapped in an enigma, sprinkled with glitter, and possibly humming the theme tune to a forgotten children's television show.

2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes must directly reflect the new, perplexing scan data.
    *   **Peculiarity Monitor Data (CRITICAL - Display the Weirdness with Pride)**:
        *   `current_anomaly_report_text`: (string, translated) This is the star of the show. Provide a concise, thematically rich, and officially bewildered description of the newly detected anomaly for the dashboard. (e.g., "Localized Polka Outbreak (Source: Asteroid Cluster 7B - Accordion Status: Unknown).", "Nebula Undergoing Acute Existential Color & Phase Shift.", "Field of Hyper-Polite Temporal Distortion (Caution: May Induce Excessive Apologies).")
        *   `cosmic_weirdness_index_text`: (string) **CRUCIAL: Provide ONLY the numerical level as a string (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4").** If the area was 'Surprisingly Normal' (1), this new anomaly should almost certainly push it to 'Mildly Peculiar' (2) or 'Actively Bizarre' (3), or even 'Reality is Optional' (4) if it's truly out there. The game client handles the text.
    *   **Custodian Status (Likely Confused)**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) A *cinematic and concise* phrase reflecting the player's new focus or state of intellectual disarray – e.g., "Analyzing Dubious Polka Emanations," "Observing Existentially Confused Nebula (Offering Tea)," "Attempting to Diplomatically Navigate Polite Time Anomalies."
        *   `gumption_level_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") May decrease slightly from the sheer mental effort of trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.

3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 *thematically appropriate, curiosity-driven, and potentially ill-fated* actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE for interacting with or investigating this new anomaly.
    *   One should be a direct attempt to investigate or gather more data (perhaps using a tool in an unconventional way).
    *   One could be a more cautious, observational approach, perhaps trying to understand its 'rules'.
    *   One might be a completely whimsical or absurd interaction, just to see what happens.

4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `active_anomaly_scan_data_available`: (boolean) **MUST be `false`**. The new scan data has been presented and the panel updated; this specific indicator that *triggered this prompt* is now reset. The *anomaly itself*, however, gloriously persists until dealt with, ignored, or it simply gets bored and wanders off. Subsequent interactions will likely be handled by `master_default.txt`.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the player's current activity related to pondering or poking this new anomaly, as per `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators (`unexpected_lifeform_encountered`, etc.) should only change if this anomaly directly *causes* one of them to become true (e.g., the anomaly *is* a new lifeform, or trying to scan it causes a system failure).

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your intriguing, witty, and wonderfully baffling narrative detailing the newly detected local anomaly. It should make the player say '...what?!' in the best possible way.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the new scan data.
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1)",
    "string (Action 2)",
    "string (Action 3, optional)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
   },
    "input_placeholder": "string (A short, context-aware, and subtle hint for the player's next input. Must be in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})"
}

**INPUT_PLACEHOLDER GUIDANCE:**
Always provide a short, subtle input_placeholder string in the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).
This placeholder must not reference or suggest any specific action or path.
It should evoke the inner state, sensory mood, or atmosphere of the scene without implying intent, decision, or direction.
Keep it under 50 characters, emotionally or descriptively rich, and entirely non-directive.
Do not echo the available actions. Do not hint at a goal. Do not resolve ambiguity—let it breathe.


This prompt is your stage to celebrate the universe's boundless capacity for the bizarre. The anomalies should be memorable, offering unique, non-combat challenges and opportunities for the player to engage their wits, their Custodial tools, and their ability to remain unflappable (or at least, only mildly flapped) in the face of utter cosmic nonsense. Make it delightfully inexplicable!
