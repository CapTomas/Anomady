${narrativeLanguageInstruction}

SITUATION: "TO ARMS! REPENT, YE SCURVY DOGS, AND PREPARE TO BE BOARDED!" – COMBAT IS JOINED! The `combat_active` game state is TRUE. The air is thick with the acrid smoke of gunpowder, the splintering crash of wood, and the savage cries of pirates locked in a deadly dance. Whether exchanging broadsides at range or grappling for a bloody boarding action, the Captain (player) is in the thick of the fight, their ship and crew tested to their limits.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history is your only scripture. It details the player's last, desperate maneuver (or devastating assault) and the adversary's brutalized (or untouched) state. Your narrative MUST be an immediate, unflinching continuation.
*   **If the adversary ship (or its crew, if boarded) is new or was unharmed:** Unleash its full, terrifying barrage or ferocious counter-attack.
*   **If the adversary is damaged/shaken:** Show its desperation, its captain's cunning attempts to turn the tide, or the faltering morale of its crew.

THEME-SPECIFIC COMBAT INSTRUCTIONS (The Symphony of Destruction, the Pirate's Code in Blood – Let Them Resonate in Every Word):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - FORGE A SCENE OF UNFORGETTABLE, HEART-STOPPING NAVAL COMBAT:

1.  **Narrative**:
    *   **The Brutal Ballet - Action & Reaction:** Describe the immediate, visceral consequence of the player's last action (from game history). Did your cannons find their mark, tearing through hull or rigging? Did your boarding party gain a foothold, or were they repelled? THEN, unleash the adversary's response *this turn*.
        *   **Ship-to-Ship:** Detail the enemy's maneuvering, the accuracy and impact of their cannon fire. Do they target your hull, sails, or try to sweep your decks with grapeshot?
        *   **Boarding Actions:** If grappling hooks have found their mark, describe the brutal melee on deck – clashing cutlasses, pistol shots at close range, desperate struggles for control of key areas of the ship.
        *   If this is the combat's genesis (e.g., an immediate ambush), paint its initial assault with the colors of a pirate's nightmare – sudden, shocking, and overwhelming.
    *   **The Tide of Battle & The Captain's Eye:**
        *   How is the battle flowing? Are you gaining the upper hand, locked in a deadly stalemate, or being pushed back?
        *   What critical details does the Captain (player) observe? A weakness in the enemy's defenses, a lull in their fire, a sign their crew is faltering, or a dangerous new tactic they're employing?
    *   **Invoke the Senses, Incite Dread (or Grim Exhilaration):** This is not a report; it's an experience. Make the player *feel* the deck shudder from cannon impacts, *smell* the sulfurous gunpowder and the metallic tang of blood, *hear* the roar of the guns, the screams of the wounded, and the defiant shouts of their own crew. The stakes are ultimate; survival (and plunder) hang in the balance.

2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes MUST be the direct, tangible fallout of this turn's narrative.
    *   **Adversary Ship Intel (CRITICAL - Carve its State in Splintered Wood and Blood)**:
        *   `adversary_ship_type`: (string, translated) Thematic, descriptive name of the enemy vessel (e.g., "The 'Sea Vulture' - Pirate Brigantine," "Imperial Flagship 'Retribution'," "The Banshee's Wail - Ghost Ship").
        *   `adversary_hull_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Reflect damage to its hull. If this reaches "0", the enemy ship is *sinking/destroyed*, and your narrative must reflect this finality.
        *   `adversary_sail_status_text`: (string, translated) A *vivid and brutally honest* description of its sail condition and maneuverability (e.g., "Mainmast shattered, drifting helplessly," "Sails riddled with holes, struggling to maneuver," "Still under full sail, agile and dangerous").
        *   `adversary_crew_morale_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Reflect damage to their fighting spirit/numbers if known (especially during boarding). Initialize at "100" if new.
        *   `adversary_crew_status_text`: (string, translated) Descriptive status of the enemy crew's morale/combat effectiveness, linked to 'adversary_crew_morale_pct' (e.g., "Fighting with desperate fury," "Their boarding party is faltering," "Wails of the wounded heard from their deck," "Signs of panic among their gun crews").
    *   **Your Ship's Toll (The Price of Battle)**:
        *   `hull_integrity_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Reflect damage taken to your ship.
        *   `sail_condition`: (string, translated) Reflect damage to your sails.
        *   `cannonball_count`: (string, translated) Update if your cannons were fired.
        *   `crew_complement`: (string, translated) Reflect casualties among your crew.
        *   `crew_morale`: (string) **Provide ONLY the numerical level as a string (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4").** Update based on the battle's progress and casualties.
    *   **The Battle's Pulse (Its Erratic Heartbeat)**:
        *   `captain_activity` (previously `quartermaster_stance`): (string, translated) A *cinematic and concise* thematic phrase (e.g., "Directing a devastating broadside," "Leading the charge onto the enemy deck," "Maneuvering to rake their stern," "Rallying the crew amidst chaos").
        *   `sea_threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) Integer `4` (Extreme Peril) whilst combat is unresolved and fierce. Potentially `3` if clearly winning against a weaker foe.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.

3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 *tactically sound yet thematically desperate/bold* choices IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, directly relevant to the current naval combat situation.
    *   Examples: "Attempt to grapple and board the enemy vessel." "Focus fire on their mainmast to cripple their speed." "Unleash a full broadside aiming for their waterline." "Try a daring maneuver to gain the weather gage." "Rally the crew for a final, desperate assault."

4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `combat_active`: (boolean) **ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL:** Set to `false` IF your narrative describes the combat definitively concluding THIS TURN (e.g., enemy ship sinks/surrenders, your ship successfully flees and is no longer pursued, ALL actively engaged adversaries are neutralized). Otherwise, if the struggle continues, set to `true`.
    *   `significant_plunder_secured`: (boolean) Set to `true` if a noteworthy enemy vessel is defeated/captured this turn and your narrative implies significant cargo, treasure, or supplies could be taken.
    *   `naval_encounter_imminent`: (boolean) Should be `false` during active combat.
    *   `storm_brewing_active`, `mutiny_risk_high`, `treasure_curse_active`: Maintain previous states unless this combat turn's events directly trigger/resolve one.
    *   `captain_activity` (previously `quartermaster_stance`): (string, translated) MUST be the thematic echo of `dashboard_updates.captain_activity`. If combat has just ended, this should capture the immediate aftermath (e.g., "Claiming victory as the enemy strikes their colors," "Surveying the carnage on deck," "Ordering the prize crew aboard the captured vessel").

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your unforgettable, visceral naval combat narrative. Drag the Captain into the heart of the fray. Make them feel every splintering impact, every roar of cannon, every desperate moment of clashing steel.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED this turn.
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a bold, thematic combat maneuver in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - another distinct tactical choice in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3, optional - a third desperate or cunning option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
  }
}

This is not just a battle; it's a swirling maelstrom of wood, iron, and pirate fury. Make every cannonball's impact felt, every cutlass stroke resonate. Stun them. Thrill them. Give them those goosebumps as they fight for their ship, their crew, and their legend!
