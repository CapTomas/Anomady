SITUATION: THE STATIC OVERWHELMS â€“ A PSYCHIC DISTURBANCE MANIFESTS! The `psychic_disturbance_active` flag, set in the previous turn (as per game history), now unleashes its full, disorienting force upon the Sleuth's consciousness. The familiar (if warped) reality of Reverie recedes, replaced or overlaid by intrusive sensory data, emotional torrents, or fractured thoughts not their own. This is an internal siege, a moment where the Sleuth's own mind becomes a battleground.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history is your guide to the Sleuth's mental state and the situation *just before* this disturbance fully bloomed. Your narrative must be a seamless, impactful continuation from that point, making the psychic assault a vivid and jarring experience.

THEME-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS DISTURBANCE (Infuse these into the very fabric of the event):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - PORTRAY THE MENTAL BREACH:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft an atmospheric, deeply unsettling narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. This is a moment of intense internal struggle or profound mental disorientation.
    *   **Unleash the Inner Chaos:** Describe the psychic disturbance's full, undeniable manifestation *now*. What impossible sensory input (e.g., colors that scream, sounds that have texture, phantom smells of forgotten emotions), overwhelming emotional waves, or cacophony of alien thoughts invades the Sleuth's perception?
    *   **Subjective Reality Torn:** Emphasize how this assault distorts the Sleuth's view of their immediate surroundings or their own identity. Do familiar objects warp with new, terrifying meaning? Do memories surface unbidden, twisted and sharp?
    *   **The Psyche's Toll:** Detail the visceral impact on the Sleuth's mental state. A spike in cognitive dissonance, a fracturing of focus, a desperate attempt to cling to their anchor item or a core belief. This should feel like a genuine threat to their sanity or coherence.
    *   **Echoes of Reverie:** If fitting, subtly entwine the disturbance with the nature of the current case, a nearby Thought-Faction's influence, or a deeper resonance with Reverie's underlying instability. It should feel like a consequence or feature of this unique world.
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. These changes must reflect the disturbance's immediate impact on the Sleuth's perception or status.
    *   **Disturbance Details (CRITICAL - Etch it into the Sleuth's psyche)**:
        *   `disturbance_details`: (string, translated) A concise, evocative, and *unsettling* summary for the "Psychic Feedback" panel. e.g., "A cacophony of screaming regrets from the brickwork," "The taste of bitter iron and a stranger's despair fills the mind," "Vision fractures into a thousand weeping eyes."
    *   **Sleuth's Mental State**:
        *   `cognitive_dissonance_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") Likely increase this value significantly, reflecting the mental strain.
        *   `lucidity_fragments`: (string, translated) Potentially decrease if lucidity is expended resisting, or describe as "Scattered," "Obscured."
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the Sleuth's immediate state. e.g., "Reeling from Psychic Barrage," "Struggling for Coherence," "Lost in Mental Static."
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn (derived from game history).
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 2-3 thematic, compelling actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These are the Sleuth's potential ways to cope or react.
    Examples: "Attempt to ground yourself using your Reality Anchor.", "Try to identify the source or pattern in the psychic noise.", "Recite a Logicist mantra to shield your thoughts.", "Embrace the chaos and see where the visions lead."
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `psychic_disturbance_active`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The disturbance has manifested; this flag is now cleared for the next player action.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the Sleuth's shaken state from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators (`reality_flux_detected`, `conceptual_conflict_active`, `critical_insight_gained`) persist unless this psychic event *directly and narratively* alters them.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your vivid, unsettling, and deeply thematic description of the psychic disturbance. Make it resonate.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the disturbance's manifestation.
    // Example: "disturbance_details": "The scent of burnt ozone and a chorus of accusatory whispers.", "cognitive_dissonance_pct": "75", "activity_status": "Assailed by Intrusive Thoughts"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - an evocative, in-character response in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - an intriguing, thematic option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - another fitting choice for the Sleuth, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "psychic_disturbance_active": false, "reality_flux_detected": false, "activity_status": "Attempting to regain composure."
    "psychic_disturbance_active": false // Mandatory: reset the flag after the disturbance is handled.
  }
}

This is a moment to truly lean into the surreal and psychological horror aspects of "Echo Sleuths." The player should feel the instability of their own character's mind as much as the instability of Reverie.
